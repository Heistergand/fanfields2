# Fan Fields 2
An INGRESS fan field planner plugin for IITC and IITCm.

Use this plugin to easily plan you fanfields. It tells you how many keys you need for each portal, shows the total amount of fields and calculates the AP you will gain just for the links and fields. Works also for star fields and classic multilayer. Does not estimate MU, sorry for that.

Thank you, 57Cell for making awesome ingress videos. This script wouldn't exist without your fanfields videos.

## Donations
If you think this is great and would like to make a donation: the world is not what it seems, so head out and donate blood in your area, register as a bone marrow donor or donate to other charities. It will change lives.
