Fanfields 2 - An INGRESS Fanfield planner plugin for IITC

I finished playing INGRESS a long time ago. No more changes will be mad in this repository.
If you like to get updates to it, developers can FORK THIS PROJECT and continue with it.

## ...and meanwhile some really did that. 

Get a glympse at the forks and what they added and fixed to make it even better:

Thank you, 57Cell for making awesome ingress videos. This script wouldn't exist without your fanfields videos.
