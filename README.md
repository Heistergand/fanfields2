Fanfields 2 - An INGRESS Fanfield planner plugin for IITC

I FINISHED PLAYING INGRESS MONTHS AGO. NO MORE CHANGES WILL BE MADE.
THE PROJECT IS NOW ARCHIVED ON GITHUB. IF YOU LIKE TO GET UPDATES TO IT, 
DEVELOPERS CAN FORK THIS PROJECT AND CONTINUE ON THEIR OWN.

## ...and meanwhile some really did that. 

Get a glympse at the forks and what they added and fixed to make it even better:
