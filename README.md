# Fan Fields 2
An INGRESS fan field planner plugin for IITC Desktop and Mobile. It is recommended to go for [IITC CE](https://iitc.app).

Use this plugin to easily plan your fanfields. It tells you how many keys you need for each portal, shows the total amount of fields and calculates the AP you will gain just for the links and fields. Works also for star fields and classic multilayer. Does not estimate MU, sorry for that.

### Field report by Agent KonnTower
Agent [KonnTower](https://community.ingress.com/en/profile/KonnTower) wrote a report about his [exercise in maxfielding - ~244 fields from 89 portals](https://community.ingress.com/en/discussion/9791/an-exercise-in-maxfielding-244-fields-from-89-portals?)

_It took three years until I stumbled over this report. It made me really happy to find it._

## Donations
The best way to say thank you is writing reports about where you used it and let me know about it.

_If you think this is great and you really like to donate something: I have all I need. But the world is not what it seems, so head out and **donate blood** in your area, register as a **bone marrow donor** or **donate money to other charities**. It will change lives._
